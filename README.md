# 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **DSA problems** that I solve while practicing on platforms like **LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, CodeChef**, and more.  

The aim of this repository is to:
- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Keep track of my progress.
- Share clean and well-documented code for learning and reference.
